=================

This is a student project to develop and implement an encrypted VoIP Protocol

It is still in pre-alpha, some functionality might not work at all.

This program should NOT be considered as secure or reliable !

It has been tested with QCreator and MSVC on Windows,
other compilers and other platforms might work.

Reviews, advices, and bug reports are welcome.

Enjoy :)
