Autor : Felix Kletti, Thomas Picariello
Organization : FHNW, ICS

=================

This is a student project to develop and implement an encrypted VoIP Protocol

It is still in pre-alpha, some functionality might not work at all.

This program should NOT be considered as secure or reliable !

It has been tested with QCreator and MSVC on Windows,
other compilers and other platforms might work.

Library Dependencies:
 - libopus: http://www.opus-codec.org/
 - jrtplib: http://research.edm.uhasselt.be/~jori/page/index.php?n=CS.Jrtplib

Reviews, advices, and bug reports are welcome.
